# ImageProcessing

Various Image Processing Tools that I have worked on over the years.


## ClassicAlgos

Is an older project where all the fundamental/classic image processing functions have been implemented.  This includes, image resizing, changing the amount of grey
levels, intensity transformations (negative, logarithmic/exponential, gamma correction, piecewise-linear, histogram based, sigmoidal), image smoothing and sharpening, and noise reduction (mean filter, order statistics filter, and adaptive filtering).

Code is written in C++ and contains both command line tools and a UI written using QT.
